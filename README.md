# Database

To store user information, we use MongoDB. It allows us to easily query data, allowing us to get the insights we need quickly. It also provides powerful features such as advanced indexing, data aggregation and data modelling. MongoDB also provides high availability, security and scalability, allowing us to trust that the data is safe and secure. In short, MongoDB is an incredibly useful database system that we're glad to use.
